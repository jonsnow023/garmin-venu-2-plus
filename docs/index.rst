🗺️ Does Garmin Venu 2 Plus Support Full Maps?

🔄 What Does “Garmin Venu 2 Plus Map Update” Actually Mean?
Because the Venu 2 Plus doesn’t support offline maps, a “map update” mainly involves:

Keeping the watch’s GPS software and firmware updated for accurate tracking

Syncing the device with the Garmin Connect app to upload routes and courses

Ensuring your phone’s GPS is connected when using Connected GPS for outdoor workouts
